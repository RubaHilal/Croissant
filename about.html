        About me

    <p>
        I am named for my historical crescent shape. the dough I am made from is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several
        times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered,
        flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry which is me.

        The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in
        various
        shapes The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of
        kipferl)
